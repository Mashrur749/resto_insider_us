#Technical Questions

1.How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

It took somewhere around 5-6 hours coding the assignment.

If I had more time I would

- add front-end caching to reduce API calls
- refine the micro-interactions
- improve error handling
- add search suggestions
- improve validations
- solidify automated testing by adding thorough functionality test
- Improve SEO by using Next.js or divide the application in segments where SEO needs to optimized, since react applications are not pre-generated, the SEO results won't be as high as a site build with Statuc Site Generators (ie: Gatsby)

  2.What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

I plan to

- use Image Net library to add feature where users can take an image of food and look up available restaurants where they can get similar kind of food
- Add map functionality for looking up distance from current location and directions

  3.How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

I'd use google analytics to achieve detailed performance report, and optimize accordingly, while I was working for RichMedia I had to optimize back-end api calls, most of the issues were resolved by fixing the queries while I was working on the API.

4.How would you improve the API that you just used?

- I would improve the API docs
- use parameters where users can access the amount of data they data (currently it doesn't take any limit parameters)

- 5.Please describe yourself using JSON.
